Intelligent Customer Help Desk With Smart Document Understanding

Project Summary:
In this developer code pattern, we use the typical customer care chatbot experience but instead of relying on predefined responses, our dialog will provide a hook that can call out to other IBM Watson® services for additional sources of information. In our case, it will be an owners manual that has been uploaded into Watson Discovery.The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual.
Project Requirements
Use Watson Assistant, IBM Cloud Functions, and Watson Discovery Smart Document
To take it a step further, we will use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
